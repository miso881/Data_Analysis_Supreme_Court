# Data_Analysis_Supreme_Court

For my third project with Nod Coding Bootcamp (January-March 2023) I performed an analysis on the ideology of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions over the past 75 years.  My goal with the analysis was to determine if the current Supreme Court constellation is one of the more liberal or convservative courts we have seen in history, as well as if the court is more divided ideologically than previous courts.  

I used two datasets from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wustl/supreme-court and  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitagpt/us-presidents) which I joined together into one table.  I then performed an exploratory anaysis on the data, using the ideology score column as my target throughout the analysis.  I used several methods from the Python Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to create my visualizations.

This was a fun project because of my previous experience in law and interest in politics, and the results of my analysis are attached here.
